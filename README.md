# Heyo! ✌🏼

My name's Taylor and I'm an enthusiastic data analyst with a passion for problem-solving and continually asking *"..., but why?"*.

In this space, you can find repositories that contain various projects I have worked on using Sheets, SQL (BigQuery), Tableau, and Python. Check 'em out!

## A bit more about me:

💾 Tech Stack: Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets, SQL, Tableau, Python, and R
👔 Strengths: communication, attention to detail, critical thinking, collaboration
🏃🏼 Unrelated: If I'm not sifting through data, I'm [hopefully] out running!
